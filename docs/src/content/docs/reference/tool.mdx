# Tool Commands
`s4n`s tool commands are designed to facilitate the interoperability with CWL CommandLineTools. The tool command itself has three subcommands for basic CR~~U~~D operations: `create`, `list` and `remove`.

!!! abstract "Usage"
    ```
    Provides commands to create and work with CWL CommandLineTools

    Usage: s4n tool <COMMAND>

    Commands:
      create  Runs commandline string and creates a tool (synonym: s4n run)
      list    Lists all tools [aliases: ls]
      remove  Remove a tool, e.g. s4n tool rm toolname [aliases: rm]
      help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

    Options:
      -h, --help  Print help
    ```

## `tool create`
The `tool create` command can be used to easily generate CWL CommandLineTools. It serves as a prefix to the usual command line prompt. Calling `tool create` with a command attached will execute the command, determine in- and outputs and create a CWL tool definition file in the `workflows` folder. `s4n tool create` has `s4n run` as alias for even less typing. 

!!! note
    Before using this command all changes need to be commited as it uses `git` to determine tool outputs!
    `git status` can be used to check beforehand.

!!! tip
    Redirection `>` and pipes `|` can be used, but need to be escaped with a backslash fot the parser to use. Otherwise the console output of `s4n` will be redirected / piped.

!!! abstract "Usage"
    ```
    Usage: s4n tool create [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...

    Arguments:
      [COMMAND]...  Command line call e.g. python script.py [ARGUMENTS]

    Options:
      -n, --name <NAME>                        A name to be used for this tool
      -c, --container-image <CONTAINER_IMAGE>  An image to pull from e.g. docker hub or path to a Dockerfile
      -t, --container-tag <CONTAINER_TAG>      The tag for the container when using a Dockerfile
      -r, --raw                                Outputs the raw CWL contents to terminal
          --no-commit                          Do not commit at the end of tool creation
          --no-run                             Do not run given command
          --clean                              Deletes created outputs after usage
          --no-defaults                        Removes default values from inputs
          --net                                Enables network in container
      -i, --inputs <INPUTS>                    Force values to be considered as an input.
      -o, --outputs <OUTPUTS>                  Force values to be considered as an output.
      -h, --help                               Print help
    ```

!!! example
    The following command will create a CWL CommandLineTool description for executing a python script `echo.py` with a txt file as parameter `--test`.
    ```
    s4n tool create python echo.py --test input.txt
    ```
    The command will create this CWL file in the workflows folder.
    ```yaml
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool

    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: echo.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../echo.py'

    inputs:
    - id: test
      type: File
      default:
        class: File
        location: '../../input.txt'
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--test'

    outputs:
    - id: results
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: results.txt

    baseCommand:
    - python
    - echo.py
    ```

### Options
With the `--name` option the resulting filename can be manipulated. Without the argument SciWIn client will automatically generate a name based on the command. If for example the same base command is used in two tools there would be a file name conflict.

The two container options `--container-image` and `--container-tag` can be used to add Docker requirements to the resulting CWL file. However Docker will **NOT** be used to execute the script while generating the tool, so make sure to either use `s4n` in Docker container or provide all neccesary tools for it to run.

With the `--raw` flag no CWL file will be written to disk. Instead the raw cwl will be outputted to the command prompt (stdout) to process it further.

As `tool create` needs all changes to be commited beforehand it will create a commit after it completed the tool creation. To prevent that because e.g. manual changes to the CWL file have to be made before committing the `--no-commit` flag can be used.

Some scripts tend to run for a very long time - e.g. quantum chemistry calculations. To prevent the tool from running the `--no-run` flag can be used. If this flag is set the parser will just use information from the command line to create the tool, outputs need to be set manually.

Sometimes it can be beneficial to not commit the created outputs. With the `--clean` flag all outputs will be deleted before commiting the freshly created tool. 

Implicit in- and outputs can be added using `-i` or `-o`. ([See Examples](../examples/tool-creation.md#implicit-inputs-hardcoded-files))

## `tool list`

`tool list` or `tool ls` can be used to list all existing tools. Using the command without the `-a` flag just ouputs the names of all existing tools in the project. Using the `-all` (or `-a`) flag will also output the tools in- and outputs which than can easily be used for the `workflow connect` command.

!!! abstract "Usage"
    ```
    Lists all tools

    Usage: s4n tool list [OPTIONS]

    Options:
      -a, --all   Outputs the tools with inputs and outputs
      -h, --help  Print help
    ```

## `tool remove`
The `tool remove` or `tool rm` command can be used to delete one or more CWL CommandLineTools. 

!!! abstract "Usage"
    ```
    Remove a tool, e.g. s4n tool rm toolname

    Usage: s4n tool remove [TOOL_NAMES]...

    Arguments:
      [TOOL_NAMES]...  Remove a tool

    Options:
      -h, --help  Print help
    ```
